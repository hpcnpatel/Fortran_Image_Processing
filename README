#============================================================================#
This is a collection of programs for processing, manupulating and filtering a CT
scan data. A CT scan data could be a binary RAW data or VTK data. All the source
code is placed in the ./source_files directory. 

Important files to be looked at while building & executing the program are,
--> ./parameter.dat
--> ./source_files/image_process.f90

#============================================================================#
How to Build

>> make -C object_files 
#============================================================================#
How to Execute

>> ./inter parameter.dat

Within the parameter.dat file, the name of the file (CT data) must be specified
along with the size of the filter to be considered. Here are the values that
can be passed to binary executable via parameter.dat file. 

The parameter.dat will look like this, 

  1 kernel_X=5
  2 kernel_Y=5
  3 kernel_Z=5
  4 fpath=./vtk/
  5 fname=file_name_of_CT_data
  6 fext=vtk
  7 np=24

kernel_X,_Y,&_Z can be used to pass the length/size of the filter in each x,y,
& z direction.

fpath=> file path name
fname=> file name without extention
fext=> file extension (for example, vtk or raw) 

#============================================================================#

Main available filters are, 

=> ADAPTIVE_MEDIAN
=> ADAPTIVE_QR
=> GRADIENT
=> MEAN
=> MEDIAN
=> QR
=> data Extrapolation filter
